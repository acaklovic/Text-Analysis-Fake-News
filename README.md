# Text-Analysis-Fake-News

Used text analysis and natural language processing (NLP) to see if we could determine how credible a news source is. Our goal was to be able to correctly label “fake news” with our model with a relatively high level of accuracy. Additionally, we found the frequency of certain words associated with “fake news,” and sentiments associated with the words and with “fake news.”
